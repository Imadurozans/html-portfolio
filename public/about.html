<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello guys, I'm Imadur Rozan Sylvano, I was previously work as an Architect, but I am currently shifting my career to be 
  a web developer, programmer, and UI UX Designer. The reason of why I am shifting my career, is because if you want to get rich, 
  don't be an Architect (in Indonesia), unless you want to get sick very often and die young, be an Architect. I've been there, trust me. 
It was a hell of experience, even in the office where it used to be our dream work place, until you taste it yourself. 
Oh, where were we?</p>

<p>Right, back to the topic, will being an Architect makes you rich? Yes, it can, but nowadays it seems impossible, unless you 
  are born very rich so you can ask your parents to build the office for you, ask for a project to be built, then repeat. Or you can also 
get rich by being an Architect by corrupting the project money, in this way, not only you will get rich, but you will also became famous as 
you thrown in the jail.</p>

<p>Yes, I got to admit that my ideal dream in the past was to become the greatest Architecct in Indonesia. And that is basically almost every 
  Architecture student's dream, until life hit you with a reality brick in the face, and your idealism is slowly fading into realistic, you have 
family to take care of, buying house, getting married, etc.</p>

<p>Once, I have read somewhere else on the internet that if you want to get rich, work smarter, not harder, and I think that is true. And I am trying 
  to make a smart decision by not becoming Architect to get rich, besides took you so long, you'll probably die earlier before getting rich. But, 
does it mean you have to be programmer, as the only way? No, I am not saying you to be a programmer, to be an A, B, C, or D. You can be anything you want 
that you think can help you get rich faster, and looking into the future, what are the most demanding project right now? What are the projects that can 
mostly sustained during pandemic? And finally, what kind of talent do we have or passion that can produce money? You gotta start asking yourself.</p>

<p>I know, I know, every field has its own pros and cons, and mastering any field isn't any easier either. But hey, at least by being a progammer, I would not 
  put anyone else's life in danger unless I am creating a mass destruction program like Skynet in Terminator. Because if you work an Architect, besides the 24/7 
and 9 to 9 workload, you gotta be super duper careful with your drawing, even just a few mm or cm difference can cost you a huge problem in the construction phase.</p>

<p>And yes, mastering any field takes time, no baby can run a marathon directly the moment they are just born. And I am trying to believe in myself and my family, 
as well as my beloved Girlfriend who keep supporting me no matter what, despite changing my career. While it might seems controversial and makes you questioning yourself 
about switching path (I felt that too) about  your idealism and dream, but hey at least I did not regret at all about my educational background and being an ex Ardchitect, 
as it trained the way you think and see the world, something that I probably might now have if I never went to Architecture collage.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, as Master Oogway once said: "Yesterday is History, Tomorrow is mystery, but today is a gift.." We will never know what will happened in the future, 
  and I'll keep be the best version of myself and keep improving.</p>

  <p>And this first noob looking website will be marking my journey to the financial freedom, until then..</p>
