<h1>The Best Movies According to Imadurozans</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr >

<h3>Ratattouile</h3>

<p>This is my favourite pixar movie. Everything about the movie
including the stories, realism, and imagination is just great! Megamind also come 
closer to this one with the way they turned the evil vs good. However, what makes 
Ratattouile special is that, how can you make a villain turned good in just few seconds? 
So far, as long as I can remember, nothing come close to that XD lmao</p>

<h3>Spiderman:Accross The Spider Verse</h3>

<p>Besides the beautiful animation style, what makes this movie great 
is that the story is full with twist that has been made from the prequel 
a.k.a the previous story, which is Spiderman: Intro the spiderverse (which is also awesome btw)</p>

<h3>Parasite (2018)</h3>

<p>Hands down the best realistic movie that actually won an oscard award 
as well, it's a Korean movie, but unlike most Korean films, this is way 
more realistic, it does not have a complex CGI like Marvel or whatsoever,
but the best part of the movie itself is coming from the story building, tension, 
character development, and the plot twist that always keep you at the edge 
of your seat whole the time!</p>

<h1>The Best Series According to Imadurozans</h1>
<h2>My top 3 series of all-time.</h2>
<hr >

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>Hands down, who doesn't know the infamous SPOILER ALERT: Ned Stark 
execution in the Season 1 ending, making it exceptional movie out there 
where nobody is safe, and not even the main character. Not to mention that every 
single action the character made, there will be the consequences later in the story, 
also great character development, and full with plot twist.
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>Probably the best anime I've ever watched, it's just so different with the rest of the other 
anime I've ever watched, the story is just great, and there is never been a wasted episode, 
every single season and episode has its own meaning, and the concept of the anti-hero is pretty
realistic as well, unlike most of other anime. And this is also the only anime (I've ever watched so far) 
that has the highest killing count, whereas the plot armor on other anime is just as thick as Reiner Armor.</p>
<h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>
<p>This might not be as best as the Attack on Titan or infamous Game of Thrones, but Naruto basically hold special place in my heart, 
    it's a good anime, I am not saying it's bad, maybe there's something that need more explanation, or the lack of character development 
    on some part, but what makes it good anime to watch is the life lessons you can actually learned from it, you get to know how the world is 
    corrupted and war everywhere (pretty accurate I would say) and how good person can turned evil and otherwise. This is just a test to see whether if there is a limit of the sentence length you can type here in the VSCODE or not, but it doesn't seems to stop.
