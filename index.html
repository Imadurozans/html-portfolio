    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello guys, thank you for visiting, and welcome to the not-so-good looking website (I know it looks so simple), as I am 
        still learning how to make a good website design yet, but I am proud of this and this will 
        be the first sign towards the successful carrier as rich and expert Web Developer (as well as UI UX Designer) 
        just wait for it.
    </p>
    <h4>Things I love (who ask?):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Sleeping</li>
        <li>Gambang cake (or gombong? I dunno)</li>
        <li>Iced tea during sunny days</li>
        <li>Potato crackers</li>
        <li>Video games, especially Zelda</li>
        <li>Money (who doesn't?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Below, you'll find my very first two HTML5 projects I've made. Sidenotes from me, you 
        can click or tap an image too to get more details about the projects.</p>
